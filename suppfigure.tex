\caption{\textbf{Features of the embryo's mothers.} \textbf{(A)} Median age of the mother at the event is XX and XX for first and recurrent miscarriages, with no significant difference. \textbf{(B)} Gestational age at the time of the pregnancy termination range from X to X weeks with no significant difference between first and recurrent cases.  \textbf{(C)} Folic acid intake. Range of values of menarche age \textbf{(D)} and Body Mass Index \textbf{(E)} in embryo's mothers are not significantly different from a control set of mothers undergoing voluntary termination of pregnancy.}
